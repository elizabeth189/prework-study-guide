# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I wanted to create this Webpage as a way to introduce myself into the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. My ultimate goal was to create a functional webpage by learning the steps involved with it, from creating HTML files to deploying the website. I learned how to write HTML files, JS script, how implement for loops and much more.

This Prework Study Guide can be used to help understand the fundamentals of creating a webpage. There are four sections that include notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If you open the DevTools console of the webpage you will be able to examine the JavaScript running, and it will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for you to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
